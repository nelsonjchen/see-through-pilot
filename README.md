# see-through-pilot

## Not actually a project.

Just archiving this discussion or idea from the now shuttered GitHub discussion

Just a placeholder post, sort of, and maybe a discussion, maybe a request for further interest, should anyone want to try to take it on. Just documenting this outside of Discord. https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/524328425415245827/913348168769490954

So, we know the C3 tracks heads, think maybe that data could be used to synthesize a see-through view from the C3 cameras?

There was an attempt here, but it didn't run up to par in UX.

BTW, this isn't a OP fork. It's a standalone prototype binary just for development to run after the UI is killed to test out maths and etc.

This attempt was nearly a year ago at a comma sponsored hacking event around November 2021.

This is a very similar to "fishtank VR", where a monitor is used as a virtual 3D volume. If helpful, my (20 year old) graduate thesis outlines a calibration method that could be repurposed here to calibrate the position of eyes, and also derives the math you need to reproject a rectangle based on a new eye position. https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0051444?o=0
